# Accent-Detection
We trained a Convolutional Neural Network model and a pre-trained model to detect the native languages of people speaking in English, to accuracies of 29% and 22% respectively, out of a set of 53 different possible languages. The models perform with much larger accuracies (75% and 65%) when classifying only the primary language group of the native language of the speakers.

We tested the same classification task on human evaluators and found that the performance of our models matched closely the accuracy of the humans, both for language group and specific language classification. Our models were trained, validated, and tested on the Speech Accent Archive database. The robustness and generalizability of the models were further tested by having them classify samples from the IDEA database, to expectedly
poor results.
